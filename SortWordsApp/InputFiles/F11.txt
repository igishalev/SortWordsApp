There are places i will remember King
King All my life though some have changed
Prince Some forever not King for better
Prince Some have gone and some remain King
Prince All these places have their moments
Prince With lovers and friends i still can recall
Prince Some are dead and some are living   King
Prince In my life I have loved them all King
